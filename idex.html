<h2> Black Butler </h2>
</div>
<img class="anime"src="images/bb1.png" alt="black butler" >
<div class="p1">
<p> <strong>Summary:</strong> Young Ciel Phantomhive is known as "the Queen's Guard Dog," taking
  care of the many unsettling events that occur in Victorian England for Her Majesty.
  Aided by Sebastian Michaelis, his loyal butler with seemingly inhuman abilities,
  Ciel uses whatever means necessary to get the job done. But is there more to this
  black-clad butler than meets the eye?

</p>
<p> <strong>My thoughts:</strong>
  This s very dark, mysterious and I love the victorian vibe to it. There's
  also a lot of investigating going on for people who are into that genre and even
  a bit of comedy. Plus everyone wants and needs a good looking butler like Sebastian</p>

<h2> Full metal alchemist (Brotherhood)</h2>
</div>
<img class="anime" src="images/fma.jpg" alt="poster">
<div class="p1">
<p><strong> Summary:</strong> Edward Elric, a young, brilliant alchemist, has
  lost much in his twelve-year life: when he and his brother Alphonse try to
  resurrect their dead mother through the forbidden act of human transmutation,
  Edward loses his brother as well as two of his limbs. With his supreme alchemy
   skills, Edward binds Alphonse's soul to a large suit of armor.

  <p><strong> My thoughts:</strong> FMA is one of the first anime that I watched
   and the story is very dynamic. The Elric brothers go through a lot; losing their
   mother to them making one of the worst mistakes in alchemy. They go thorugh
   hardships and learn along the way of their journey. There is also a good amount
   of comedy in there as well.</p>

<h2> Hellsing ultimate</h2>
</div>
<img class="anime" src="images/hellsing.jpg" alt="poster">
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>Summary:</strong>Hellsing, an organization specializing in dealing
   with supernatural threats, is called in to eliminate a vampire that is turning
   the villagers of Cheddar into ghouls. To put an end to this, the leader of the
   organization, Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, dispatches her most formidable
   asset: a powerful vampire known as Alucard.

  <p><strong> My thoughts:</strong> Okay, I know what you're thinking, what's with
    all the gory and dark shows? Well it's just my taste okay, not all are like this.
    This show has everything; a bada** vampire, nazis, war and all other messed up
    stuff. Alucard is just as cool as you can imagine a thousand year old vampire to be.
     The animation in ultimate is soooo good. And the artstyle is to
    die for. Not literally of course. Well maybe.

  <h2> kamisama kiss</h2>
</div>
<img class="anime" src="images/kiss.png" alt="poster">
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>Summary:</strong>High schooler Nanami Momozono has quite a few problems
   of late, beginning with her absentee father being in such extreme debt that they
   lose everything. Downtrodden and homeless, she runs into a man being harassed by
   a dog. After helping him, she explains her situation, and to her surprise, he
   offers her his home in gratitude. But when she discovers that said home is a
   rundown shrine, she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits
   and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake her for the man Nanami rescued—the
   land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as
   a replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human.

     Read more.</a>
  <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> See? this one is more light hearted. A little
    old school, kamisama Kiss is a fantasy rom-com that I was somewhat reluctant
    to watch, but ended up binging all the episodes in one night. Yes it's that
    interesting. A sassy fox spirit who falls in love with a human girl?
    What's not to love?

  <h2> Kill la kill</h2>
</div>
<img class="anime" src="images/klk.jpg" alt="poster"/>
<div class="p2">
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong>After the murder of her father, Ryuuko Matoi has
    been wandering the land in search of his killer. Following her only lead—the
    missing half of his invention, the Scissor Blade—she arrives at the prestigious
    Honnouji Academy, a high school unlike any other. The academy is ruled by the
    imposing and cold-hearted student council president Satsuki Kiryuuin alongside
     her powerful underlings, the Elite Four. In the school's brutally competitive
     hierarchy, Satsuki bestows upon those at the top special clothes called "Goku
     Uniforms," which grant the wearer unique superhuman abilities.

<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Okay, I'm not sure if you can tell but this one
 is a little lewd. Justtt a little. Don't let that deter you. This anime
  will bring you on a roller coster ride of emotions. The artsyle is unique
  and the character designs are pretty cool too. And I absloutely love Ryooko's
  confidence. </p>
